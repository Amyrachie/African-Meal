    <h1>UGBA: THE HEART OF TRADITIONAL IGBO MEALS</h1>
    <p>Ugba, also called Ukpaka, is a Nigerian indigenous food ingredient. Although it is used as an ingredient by several ethnic groups in Nigeria, it is a common ingredient among the Igbo’s in the Eastern part of Nigeria. It goes by several names including ukana by Efik people and Apara by the Yoruba tribe. 
Ugba is a protein-rich food that is got by solid state fermentation of seeds of African oil bean (Pentaclethra macrophylla) seed.
With a short shelf life of about 3-5 days, Ugba is a basic food item used in cooking and preparing certain ceremonial traditional dishes. In Igbo land, ugba is used to make Abacha (also known as African salad), and mixed with cooked stock fish,  to mention a few.
